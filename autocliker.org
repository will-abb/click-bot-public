* Click Like A Human
** logic
*** random time interval in between clicks
**** This is dynamic so standard deviation changes
***** This means time intervals change randomly also
*** random time click is held down
**** This is dynamic so standard deviation changes
***** This means time intervals change randomly also
*** human fatigue must be implemented
**** As time goes on, time intervals increase
**** Implement a "rest period" where clicking rate decreases significantly for a short time and then resumes
*** mouse movements
**** disable mouse movement
***** Specific key enables it again
**** CANCELLED enable mouse movement
***** Random small movement of the mouse :optional:
****** Random time interval
****** Must come back to initial position eventually
***** mouse movements trigger events
****** Send a notification
****** End the script :optional:
******* Random small movement must be disabled
*** script has max timer
**** Specify in seconds
*** CANCELLED click patterns
**** Implement a small random offset for each click location
*** breaks
**** Simulate natural breaks where clicking stops for a short period, mimicking a human taking a break
*** error handling
**** Implement robust error handling to ensure the script can recover gracefully from unexpected issues
*** customization
**** Allow users to customize parameters such as click speed, hold time, and fatigue rate through the GUI or configuration files
** Packaging
*** provide a gui
**** Disable movements
**** CANCELLED Enable movements
***** Random small movement option
***** End script if movement option
**** Run script for time option
*** TODO provide as a pip package
